I don't use these maths functions often enough for them to stick in my head when I need them. I'm
developing this cheat sheet to help me have a handy reference when needed.

## Topics to cover

1. Movement (position, velocity, acceleration - derivatives and integrals)
1. Vectors
1. Matrices
1. Collision detection

## Linear colour blending for RGB colours

Linear colour blending for RGB colours uses linear interpolation between each colour.
To blend colour A (`fg`) onto colour B (`bg`) using colour A's alpha channel value (`a`):

> _blended colour = bg + (fg - bg) * a_

Or with the same formula rearranged:

> _blended colour = bg * (1.0 - a) + fg * a_

For example, assuming two colours A (255, 0, 0, 102) and B (0, 255, 255, 255) in RGBA format):

> a = 102 / 255 = 0.4
>
> red   = 0   * (1.0 - 0.4) + 255 * 0.4 = 102
> green = 255 * (1.0 - 0.4) + 0 * 0.4   = 153
> blue  = 255 * (1.0 - 0.4) + 0 * 0.4   = 153
>
> blended colour = (102, 153, 153, 255) 
>
> _n.b.: alpha value of 255/1.0 means fully opaque and 0/0.0 means fully transparent._

## Angle of rotation

The angle of rotation can be computed from the velocity using the inverse tangent or _arctan_:
A diagram would be helpful, but in the absence of such a thing, the laymans rationale for this is as follows.
Imagine drawing a line from the origin of a circle along the x-axis the length of the velocity in the horizontal component.
Draw a similar line from the end of the first along the y-axis the length of the velocity in the vertical component.
Now imagine drawing a line from the origin of the circle to the tip of the previous line, forming the hypotenuse of a triangle.
The angle between the x-axis and the hypotenuse is the rotation, which can be calculated by computing the inverse tangent, _ùõ≥ = tan^-1(y/x)_.

In code:

```rust
let velocity_x = 3.0_f32;
let veolcity_y = 3.0_f32;
let rotation = velocity_y.atan2(velocity_x);
```

## 2D rotation about a point

> _x' = xcosùõ≥ - ysinùõ≥_
> _y' = ycosùõ≥ + xsinùõ≥_

Where _ùõ≥_ is the amount of radians by which to perform the rotation.
This rotation must be carried out about the origin and then translated.
