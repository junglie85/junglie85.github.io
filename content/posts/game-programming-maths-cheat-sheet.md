I don't use these maths functions often enough for them to stick in my head when I need them. I'm
developing this cheat sheet to help me have a handy reference when needed.

## Topics to cover

1. Movement (position, velocity, acceleration - derivatives and integrals)
1. Vectors
1. Matrices
1. Collision detection
