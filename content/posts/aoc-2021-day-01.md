[Source code](https://github.com/junglie85/aoc-2021/commit/b7541d4f4477c99c7ac68138232ce36a4a9488a7) for this solution can be found in the associated GitHub repository.

## Part 1

The first challenge requires finding out how many times the values in a list increase from the number before it.
For example, with the following sample input we can see that the values increase 7 times:

```
199 (N/A - no previous measurement)
200 (increased)
208 (increased)
210 (increased)
200 (decreased)
207 (increased)
240 (increased)
269 (increased)
260 (decreased)
263 (increased)
```

Let's use this sample data to create a program in `src/bin/day01a.rs` that will solve the challenge!
Let's handle the cases where there are only zero or 1 measurements; we'll return a `0`.

```rust
fn calculate_increase(_measurements: Vec<usize>) -> usize {
    0
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn zero_measurements_has_no_increase() {
        let measurements = Vec::new();

        let increase = calculate_increase(measurements);

        assert_eq!(0, increase);
    }

    #[test]
    fn one_measurement_has_no_increase() {
        let measurements = vec![199];

        let increase = calculate_increase(measurements);

        assert_eq!(0, increase);
    }
}
```

Great! Now let's handle the following 3 cases, each with 2 measurements:
- an increase from 1st to 2nd measurement.
- no increase from 1st to 2nd measurement.
- a decrease from 1st to 2nd measurement.

Since all 3 cases will pass with the same implementation, we'll write all 3 tests in one go:

```rust
#[test]
fn increase_from_measurement_1_to_2_is_an_increase() {
    let measurements = vec![199, 200];

    let increase = calculate_increase(measurements);

    assert_eq!(1, increase);
}

#[test]
fn no_change_from_measurement_1_to_2_is_not_an_increase() {
    let measurements = vec![199, 199];

    let increase = calculate_increase(measurements);

    assert_eq!(0, increase);
}

#[test]
fn decrease_from_measurement_1_to_2_is_not_an_increase() {
    let measurements = vec![201, 200];

    let increase = calculate_increase(measurements);

    assert_eq!(0, increase);
}
```

To get these tests to pass, we need to amend the `calculate_increase` function.
We'll iterate over the range of the measurements starting from the second entry.
This allows us to compare against the previous entry; the guard clause ensures we don't try to access non-existant elements.

```rust
fn calculate_increase(measurements: Vec<usize>) -> usize {
    let mut increase = 0;

    if measurements.len() >= 2 {
        for i in 1..measurements.len() {
            if measurements[i] > measurements[i - 1] {
                increase += 1;
            }
        }
    }

    increase
}
```

With this in place, we should be able to check our implementation against the sample measurements:

```rust
#[test]
fn given_list_of_sample_data_calculates_increase_of_7() {
    let measurements = vec![199, 200, 208, 210, 200, 207, 240, 269, 260, 263];

    let increase = calculate_increase(measurements);

    assert_eq!(7, increase);
}
```

The final step is to load the real measurement data from file and compute the actual increase.
We'll save the measurements in `${projectRoot}/data/day01a.txt` and to avoid dealing with path issues we'll `include_str!`.
Let's see what the implementation looks like:

```rust
fn main() {
    let raw_measurements = include_str!("../../data/day01a.txt");

    let measurements = raw_measurements
        .trim()
        .split('\n')
        .filter_map(|m| str::parse::<usize>(m).ok())
        .collect();

    let increase = calculate_increase(measurements);

    println!("{}", increase);
}
```

{{< alert "circle-info" >}}
The interesting bit here is the `filter_map`, which is shorthand for `map().filter().map()`.
Without this, we'd have to write:

```rust
let measurements = raw_measurements
    .trim()
    .split('\n')
    .map(str::parse::<usize>)
    .filter(|m| m.is_ok())
    .map(|m| m.unwrap())
    .collect();
```
{{< /alert >}}

Sometimes `collect` requires us to specify the type to be collected into.
This is needed if the compiler cannot infer the type, which in our case it can.

With this in place, we can run the tool:

```commandline
cargo run --bin day01a
1154
```

⭐️, now let's look at the second part of the task.

## Part 2

In this part of the challenge, we need to compare a sliding window of 3 measurements over the same list of measurements.
Given the previous sample data, our sliding window data would yield the following sums, with 5 increases:

```
A: 607 (N/A - no previous sum)
B: 618 (increased)
C: 618 (no change)
D: 617 (decreased)
E: 647 (increased)
F: 716 (increased)
G: 769 (increased)
H: 792 (increased)
```

I'd like to reuse as much of the previous code as possible.
The first thing we'll do is extract the `calculate_increase` function and tests into a `day01.rs` library.
We need to remember to make the function `pub` and export it from `lib.rs`.
With these changes in place, we're almost ready to start updating our implementation.
However, I want to make two more changes that will prevent our existing tests and implementation from breaking.
The first is to add a `calculate_increase_windowed` function and delegate to it from `calculate_increase`:

```rust
pub fn calculate_increase_windowed(measurements: Vec<usize>, _window_size: usize) -> usize {
    let mut increase = 0;

    if measurements.len() >= 2 {
        for i in 1..measurements.len() {
            if measurements[i] > measurements[i - 1] {
                increase += 1;
            }
        }
    }

    increase
}

pub fn calculate_increase(measurements: Vec<usize>) -> usize {
    calculate_increase_windowed(measurements, 1)
}
```

Next, we'll make some changes to the logic in our `calculate_increase_windowed` function to use the `windows` method on a slice.
We can set the window size to 1 and keep the functionality exactly the same as when we finished Part 1]:

```rust
pub fn calculate_increase_windowed(measurements: Vec<usize>, window_size: usize) -> usize {
    let mut increase = 0;
    let mut last_measurement = None;

    for m in measurements[..].windows(window_size) {
        let window_sum = m.iter().sum::<usize>();
        if let Some(last_sum) = last_measurement {
            if window_sum > last_sum {
                increase += 1;
            }
        }
        last_measurement = Some(window_sum);
    }

    increase
}
```

As can be seen, our implementation has changed a little bit.
We now keep track of the `last_measurement` and iterate over a window in a slice of `measurements`.
The `windows` method only exists on slices, not a vec.
We use one of Rust's many functional tools to calculate the `sum` of window.
Then we compare the `window_sum` with the `last_sum` and increment the `increase` when the conditions are right.
Using the `Option` is a convenient way to keep track of whether we're comparing against the first sum or a subsequent value.
All our tests should still be passing and the `day01a` binary should still result in the correct increase.
However, we've now made the necesary changes to make our update to use a window of 3 an easy change.
Let's write a test and get to it!

```rust
#[test]
fn given_list_of_sample_data_with_window_of_3_calculates_increase_of_5() {
    let measurements = vec![199, 200, 208, 210, 200, 207, 240, 269, 260, 263];

    let increase = calculate_increase_windowed(measurements, 3);

    assert_eq!(5, increase);
}
```

And if we run the test... straight to green!
That's right.
Our refactoring was into an implementation that works for the second task straight away.
We could have been a bit more deliberate and waitied to introduce the `calculate_increase_windowed` function.
However, I don't think there's anything wrong with introducing that earlier.

All that remains is to add `src/bin/day01b.rs` and call our new function.
Apart from that change, it's the same as `day01a.rs`.

```rust
use aoc_2021::day01::calculate_increase_windowed;

fn main() {
    let raw_measurements = include_str!("../../data/day01a.txt");

    let measurements = raw_measurements
        .trim()
        .split('\n')
        .filter_map(|m| str::parse::<usize>(m).ok())
        .collect();

    let increase = calculate_increase_windowed(measurements, 3);

    println!("{}", increase);
}
```

Which we can run:

```commandline
cargo run --bin day01b
1127
```

So, great success, let's reward ourselves with another ⭐️.
